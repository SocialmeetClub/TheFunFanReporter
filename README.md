### 💡 The Vision: The Gig Economy for Massive Events
**TheFunFanReporter** is a hyper-local, real-time intelligence network designed for the world's biggest logistical nightmares: **The Super Bowl, World Cup, Coachella, and Olympics.**

It turns 75,000 attendees into paid reporters. If you are stuck in traffic and a local tips you off to a secret route, you tip them.
*   **The Model:** A clear **50/50 Revenue Split**.
*   **The Scale:** 50% to the Reporter, 50% to the Platform.

### 🏗️ The Architecture: A True Frankenstein
We didn't just write code; we performed surgery. We stitched together technologies that usually hate each other to create a monster.

1.  **🧟‍♂️ The Body (High Impact Legacy):** **WordPress** (Hostinger).
    *   Powers 43% of the web. It handles SEO, Trust, and User Accounts.
    *   **The Mothership:** Connected to **TheHumanTeam.org**, our HQ where verified users buy "Meritocracy Coins" (Credits/Points, **NO Crypto**).
2.  **⚡ The Brain (Modern Speed):** **Node.js + Socket.io** (Render Cloud).
    *   A high-concurrency stateful server handling thousands of live connections per second.
3.  **👨‍⚕️ The Mad Scientist (The Architect):** **Kiro AI**.
    *   I am a non-technical solo founder. **Kiro was my Co-Pilot.**
    *   We used **Spec-Driven Development** inside Kiro to write the complex bridge code that connects the PHP Body to the Node.js Brain seamlessly.
4.  **🧵 The Glue:** A custom Vanilla JS Widget (`chat-widget.js`) injected into the WP Footer.

### 💰 The Business: "Speedboat vs Mothership"
*   **The Mothership (TheHumanTeam.org):** The Bank. Users buy credits here.
*   **The Speedboat (TheFunFanReporter.com):** The Tactical Deployment. A temporary, 24-hour pop-up chat for specific events.
*   **The Currency:** **Meritocracy Coin**. Pegged to the US Federal Minimum Wage ($7.25).

### 🚀 How to Run Locally (For Judges)
If you want to examine the "Brain" logic locally:

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SocialMeetClub/TheFunFanReporter.git
    cd TheFunFanReporter
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    *(The server runs on port 3000 locally)*

### ⚠️ Note on Live Testing
**TRY THE LIVE DEMO HERE:** 👉 [https://thefunfanreporter.com/kiro/](https://thefunfanreporter.com/kiro/)

The backend uses a **Render.com Free Tier** server.
*   **If the chat shows "Disconnected" initially:** Please wait **30-50 seconds** for the server to wake up from sleep mode.
*   **Once awake:** It is instant and real-time.
